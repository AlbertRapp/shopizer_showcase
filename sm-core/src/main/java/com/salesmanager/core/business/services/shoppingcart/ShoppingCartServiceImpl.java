 * DESCRIPTION: Avoid string concatenation inside loops.  Since strings are immutable, concatenation is a greedy operation. This creates unnecessary temporary objects and results in quadratic rather than linear running time. In a loop, instead using concatenation, add each substring to a list and join the list after the loop terminates (or, write each substring to a byte buffer).
 * OUTLINE: The code line `shoppingCart.setObsolete(true);` is most likely affected. - Reasoning: The line sets the 'obsolete' flag of the shopping cart, which is not related to the finding. - Proposed solution: Not applicable. No action needed.  The code line `return shoppingCart;` is most likely affected. - Reasoning: The line returns the shopping cart object, which is not related to the finding. - Proposed solution: Not applicable. No action needed.  The code line `LOGGER.debug("Populate item " + item.getId());` is most likely affected. - Reasoning: The line concatenates the item ID with a string, which is related to the finding. - Proposed solution: Instead of concatenating the item ID with a string inside the loop, it is recommended to add each substring to a list and join the list after the loop terminates. This avoids unnecessary temporary objects and improves performance.  The code line `getPopulatedItem(item, store);` is not affected. - Reasoning: The line calls a method with the 'item' object as a parameter, which is not related to the finding. - Proposed solution: Not affected - No action needed.

 * TITLE: Avoid nested loops
 * DESCRIPTION: This rule finds all loops containing nested loops.  Nested loops can be replaced by redesigning data with hashmap, or in some contexts, by using specialized high level API...  With hashmap: The literature abounds with documentation to reduce complexity of nested loops by using hashmap.  The principle is the following : having two sets of data, and two nested loops iterating over them. The complexity of a such algorithm is O(n^2). We can replace that by this process : - create an intermediate hashmap summarizing the non-null interaction between elements of both data set. This is a O(n) operation. - execute a loop over one of the data set, inside which the hash indexation to interact with the other data set is used. This is a O(n) operation.  two O(n) algorithms chained are always more efficient than a single O(n^2) algorithm.  Note : if the interaction between the two data sets is a full matrice, the optimization will not work because the O(n^2) complexity will be transferred in the hashmap creation. But it is not the main situation.  Didactic example in Perl technology: both functions do the same job. But the one using hashmap is the most efficient.  my $a = 10000; my $b = 10000;  sub withNestedLoops() {     my $i=0;     my $res;     while ($i < $a) {         print STDERR "$i\n";         my $j=0;         while ($j < $b) {             if ($i==$j) {                 $res = $i*$j;             }             $j++;         }         $i++;     } }  sub withHashmap() {     my %hash = ();          my $j=0;     while ($j < $b) {         $hash{$j} = $i*$i;         $j++;     }          my $i = 0;     while ($i < $a) {         print STDERR "$i\n";         $res = $hash{i};         $i++;     } } # takes ~6 seconds withNestedLoops();  # takes ~1 seconds withHashmap();
 * OUTLINE: The code line `if ((productAttributes != null && productAttributes.size() > 0) || (cartAttributes != null && cartAttributes.size() > 0))` is most likely affected.  - Reasoning: It checks if either `productAttributes` or `cartAttributes` is not null and has elements, which is related to the finding of avoiding nested loops.  - Proposed solution: Not affected - The code line is already checking for the presence of elements in `productAttributes` and `cartAttributes`, which is necessary for the logic of the code.

 * DESCRIPTION: Object instantiation uses memory allocation, that is a greedy operation. Doing an instantiation at each iteration could really hamper the performances and increase resource usage.  If the instantiated object is local to the loop, there is absolutely no need to instantiate it at each iteration : create it once outside the loop, and just change its value at each iteration. If the object is immutable, create if possible a mutable class. If the aim is to create a consolidated data structure, then, unless the need is to release the data case by case, it could be better to make a single global allocation outside the loop, and fill it with data inside the loop.
 * OUTLINE: The code line `Set<ShoppingCartItem> shoppingCartItemsSet = null;` is most likely affected. - Reasoning: The variable `shoppingCartItemsSet` is being instantiated inside the loop, which is mentioned in the finding. - Proposed solution: Move the instantiation of `shoppingCartItemsSet` outside of the loop to avoid instantiating it at each iteration.

 * DESCRIPTION: This rule finds all loops containing nested loops.  Nested loops can be replaced by redesigning data with hashmap, or in some contexts, by using specialized high level API...  With hashmap: The literature abounds with documentation to reduce complexity of nested loops by using hashmap.  The principle is the following : having two sets of data, and two nested loops iterating over them. The complexity of a such algorithm is O(n^2). We can replace that by this process : - create an intermediate hashmap summarizing the non-null interaction between elements of both data set. This is a O(n) operation. - execute a loop over one of the data set, inside which the hash indexation to interact with the other data set is used. This is a O(n) operation.  two O(n) algorithms chained are always more efficient than a single O(n^2) algorithm.  Note : if the interaction between the two data sets is a full matrice, the optimization will not work because the O(n^2) complexity will be transferred in the hashmap creation. But it is not the main situation.  Didactic example in Perl technology: both functions do the same job. But the one using hashmap is the most efficient.  my $a = 10000; my $b = 10000;  sub withNestedLoops() {     my $i=0;     my $res;     while ($i < $a) {         print STDERR "$i\n";         my $j=0;         while ($j < $b) {             if ($i==$j) {                 $res = $i*$j;             }             $j++;         }         $i++;     } }  sub withHashmap() {     my %hash = ();          my $j=0;     while ($j < $b) {         $hash{$j} = $i*$i;         $j++;     }          my $i = 0;     while ($i < $a) {         print STDERR "$i\n";         $res = $hash{i};         $i++;     } } # takes ~6 seconds withNestedLoops();  # takes ~1 seconds withHashmap();
