 * DESCRIPTION: Not closing files explicitly into your programs can occur memory issues. Leaving files opened unnecessarily has many downsides. They may consume limited system resources such as file descriptors.

The code line `try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file)) {` is most likely affected. - Reasoning: It opens an input stream without explicitly closing it. - Proposed solution: Add a `finally` block after the try-with-resources block to explicitly close the input stream.
